## About This
Help me make a portfolio by letting people from all over the world contribute with their own ideas and design!

If you have any questions or requests feel free to message me!

***Disclaimer! This is a project for fun! I do not expect a profesional or high standard website for free.***

## What to Do
- Keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts
- Make sure there is no merge conflict
- Fun things! This is not suppose to be serious. Be creative and add easter eggs
- **Try to fix all merge issues**

## What not to Do
- Spam! Small contributions like minor styling or spell correction is accepted but obvious spam for the t-shirt will be labeled invalid.
- Use prettier/auto indent/auto format because it will create HUGE merge conflicts
- Add any build steps e.g npm install (I want to keep this a simple static site)
